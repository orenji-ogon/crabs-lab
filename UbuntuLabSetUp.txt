# Ubuntu VM Lab Environment

This repository documents the setup and configuration of my Ubuntu VM used for coursework and lab practice.  
The VM is configured as a development and database environment with remote access enabled.

## Features
- **Remote Access**: XRDP + Remmina for full desktop sessions at 1920x1080 resolution.
- **Database**: MySQL Server installed and secured, with a dedicated coursework user.
- **GUI Tools**: MySQL Workbench for schema design and query practice.
- **Development Stack**:
  - Python3 + pip for scripting
  - Bash shell with custom aliases
  - VSCodium for coding and project work
- **Spice/QXL Integration**: Guest tools installed for improved VM graphics and responsiveness.

## Usage
- Connect to the VM via Remmina (RDP).
- Launch MySQL Workbench inside the VM and connect to `localhost` using the coursework user.
- Use CLI (`mysql -u <user> -p`) for SQL practice.
- Develop scripts in Python or Bash, edit with VSCodium.

## Notes
- Root MySQL account is secured; coursework user is recommended for daily tasks.
- Firewall rules and Unifi zone-based setup will be documented separately once rack equipment is installed.
- This VM serves as the foundation for Python scripting, Bash scripting, MySQL labs, and coursework in Workbench.
